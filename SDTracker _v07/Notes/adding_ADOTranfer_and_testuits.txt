This part I assume will go smooth because I haven't ran into problems in the past.

ADOTransfer does not depend on the other projects.

ADOTransfer is a consol project to transfer data from the MySql database to the SQLServer database.
This requires the MySql.Data.dll in Assemplies 
MySql.Data version 6.9.5.0

Add the folder structure: and import files.
SQL_scripts
- Build
- Debug
- Delete
- Insert
- Reports
- Select
- Tables
- Update

Build and save.
