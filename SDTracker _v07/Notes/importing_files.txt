Add respective files

After adding the files (first folder level) I had noticed that Git had some changes in the Web Project part of this soulution.
Made a commit.
Git Recognitions seems to be slow. working on importing files

Second level fodlers:


Reports
Config


When adding the files in there were problems in the references:

System.Web.Mvc  resolved by manage NuGet
System.Configuration resolved at adding references 

In Assemblies:
System.Configuration v 4.0.0.0

To resolve Imports on the Web Project SDTracker

Added Microsoft.AspNet.Web.Optimization Via NuGet

Microsoft.AspNet.Web.Optimization
as A result of this you will need to add
<add namespace="System.Web.Optimization" /> 
to the View/Web.Config

Also note that you will need to replace the auto generated Global.asax file because it uses the namespace "SDTracker_vXX"

In Properties You need to change the Name Space
This modifies the Global.asax and xml

Web.Config
OK..

At this point the web application is ready to run. Depending on the status of the DB of course.
