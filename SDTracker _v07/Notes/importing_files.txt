Add respective files

After adding the files (first folder level) I had noticed that Git had some changes in the Web Project part of this soulution.
Made a commit.
Git Recognitions seems to be slow. working on importing files

Second level fodlers:


Reports
Config


When adding the files in there were problems in the references:

System.Web.Mvc  resolved by manage NuGet
System.Configuration resolved at adding references 

In Assemblies:
System.Configuration v 4.0.0.0

To resolve Imports on the Web Project SDTracker

Added Microsoft.AspNet.Web.Optimization Via NuGet
Also note that you will need to replace the auto generated Global.asax file because it uses the namespace "SDTracker_vXX"
