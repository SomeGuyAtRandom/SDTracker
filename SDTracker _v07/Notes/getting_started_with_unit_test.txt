ASP.NET MVC unit tests directly call methods of the MVC controllers. When a unit test calls an action method in a controller, 
you can validate that the correct view is returned (although you do not validate the HTML) and that view data is returned. 
You can also test whether a method correctly redirects to another controller or view.
Because I want to explore TTD.
I decided that I would use the pre-baked project provided by VS2013 and these are the steps to create that project.
File -> New -> Project
Installed -> Visual C# -> Web -> ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Application
Name: Same Naming Convention
OK
Here I select Internet Application. 
This option will give me all the required scaffolding for a working Internet Application.
I make sure the Create a unit test project is checked.
The only selection I have is Visual Studio Unit Tests
OK
My first step will to strip out the models.
So I add a new Class Library Called BusinessLayer, here I will place the DbContext and the Models.
