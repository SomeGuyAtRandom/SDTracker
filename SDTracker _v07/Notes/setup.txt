The Visual Studio Environment I created at home uses Windows 7
Git
IIS
SQL Server
Starting with a Blank MVC 4 ASP.NET Web Application.
Named it SDTracker _vXX.
Add to source control? (Around v07). Still only Visual Studio Unit Test
Use Razor
Create Test Project? (Around v04).
Make sure you have checked Create a unit test project in the set up.
After you have installed Git (on the system) and then added the Git server provider trough NuGet
This point you will get the pop up and select Git.
Adding the Models Project:
In design I choose to create a different project for the Models called the BusinessLayer.
BusinessLayer is a C# class library.
Thus I deleted the file Class1.cs
Setting Up JavaScript, Bootstrap and JQuery:
This part will be new as of version 8 (use 7+ files to populate).
Add a Shared folder to Views.


//TODO: Look at creating_the_project_from_scratch and move contents into here and combine as one file

Next I did Tool -> Options -> Source Control -> Plug-in Secion:
And selected Git Source Control Provider
