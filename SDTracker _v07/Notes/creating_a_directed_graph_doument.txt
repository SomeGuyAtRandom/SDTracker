Creation of Visual Studio items using a wizard.
In the open project to create a Class Diagram I followed the following steps:
File -> New -> File
The New File Template window is then opened.
On the left I select Installed -> General
In the Center pain I select the Directed Graph Document icon and clicked the open button at the lower right corner.
This opens the Graph viewer. In this window you can add objects by selecting items on the current project.

Note that when the document is created, the name is Graph1.dgml
The dgml file can be found in the 
[User]\AppData\Local\Temp\~vs[some random value].dgml
Directory. This is just a temporary file. If you close the project now, you will not get a warning to save the file. 
And if you re-open the project and create the same file again, it will have the same, original, default name but most likely 
a different random temporary name.
